Description: 'finetune' enhances the 'tune' package by providing more 
 specialized methods for finding reasonable values of model tuning parameters. 
 Two racing methods described by Kuhn (2014) <arXiv:1405.6974> are included. An
 iterative search method using generalized simulated annealing (Bohachevsky, 
 Johnson and Stein, 1986) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1986.10488128> is also included.
